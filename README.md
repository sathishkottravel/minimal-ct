Minimal Contour Tree algorithms to work with Inviwo framework

This repository is primarily useful for visual analysis of scalar data
using contour tree based analysis.

Also includes several experimental modules such as MesherUtils.

The tool-sets in this repository has its basis from TopoAngler 
(https://github.com/ViDA-NYU/Segmentangling )

This repository consists modules for Inviwo Framework (https://inviwo.org/)

This project has sub-modules of several github projects listed as follows:
